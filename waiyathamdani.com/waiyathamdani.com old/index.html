        <div class="container">
          <p class="biggerparagraph">
            My name is Waiyat Hamdani. I’m was born in Indonesia on December 12, 1991. I come to the United state on January 8th, 2010. When I come to the United States I cannot speak English perfectly. Time to time I brought a dictionary to understand the word that people say to me. Sometimes, I tried to buy food and I don’t understand the word and I took a bit of time.Because of that people behind me got so angry. However, after I graduate from Greenwich High-school. I decide to join the US Military because I have no idea what to study. In the beginning, I like the military life and I start to make my life plan to stay working there forever. However, sometimes your life never going as your plan and I got an honorable discharge from the US military.
          </p>

          <p class="biggerparagraph">
            After military, I ended up attending Norwalk Community College on January 2015 and applying Computer Science. At first, I wasn’t good at it. However, because of the determination, I was able to write a simple application from my program. I was so happy. From there my life changed for the better. I was able to solve the problem with my head with a calming matter. Not very long after that, I got my Associates's degree in “computer science”. I felt I want to study more about computer science have to offer. So, I decided to apply a Bachelor's degree at Southern Connecticut State University. I was able to achieve my BS. Computer science Information System in May 2020. I'm glad that I found Computer Science. Not only improve me in my technical skill but also improve me how to solve a problem calmly.  I'm glad I able to change , and made a society a better place. I'm truly grateful for all my teacher that teach me and mold me into who I am today. I also want to thanks my mom , who have patience with me. I know , I wasn't always in my best behaviour, but I always trying to make you happy.Thank you very much... I dunno what can I do without you guys.
